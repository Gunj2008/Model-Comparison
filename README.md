## Features

- **Model Benchmarking**: Evaluate AI models on standard datasets and custom test cases.
- **Performance Metrics**: Compare models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, latency, throughput, and more.
- **Visualization Tools**: Generate charts and plots for performance comparisons.
- **Custom Datasets**: Integrate and test models on your own datasets.
- **Extensibility**: Add new models and metrics easily.
